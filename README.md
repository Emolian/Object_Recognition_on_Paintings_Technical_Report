The project will automatically download any files which are required of it. Upon the run, files and folders will be generated which will showcase the results I was speaking of in the report itself.

The model which is trained on the third phase will be saved in the project upon a successful training session, making any repeated tests easier to perform.

If you somehow wish to train another model instead of using the old saved one, you merely have to remove it and the program will train a new one upon the next run.
